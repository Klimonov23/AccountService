#### Statistics service
Performs calculations on major statistics parameters and captures time series for each account. Datapoint contains values normalized to base currency and time period. This data is used to track cash flow dynamics during the account lifetime.

PUT	| /statistics/{account}	| Create or update time series datapoint for specified account	|   | 


#### Notification service
Stores user contact information and notification settings (reminders, backup frequency etc). Scheduled worker collects required information from other services and sends e-mail messages to subscribed customers.

Method	| Path	| Description	| User authenticated	| Available from UI
------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |:-------------:|:----------------:|
GET	| /notifications/settings/current	| Get current account notification settings	| × | ×	
PUT	| /notifications/settings/current	| Save current account notification settings	| × | ×

#### Notes
- Each microservice has its own database, so there is no way to bypass API and access persistence data directly.
- MongoDB is used as a primary database for each of the services.
- All services are talking to each other via the Rest API
